      <h3>Project Overview</h3>

        <h6><i>Mass Offline Data Storage</i></h6>
        <p>I was reminded of the need for this project when I read <a href="PDF Articles/All Unsorted/Could the Internet Archive go out like Napster_.pdf">this article</a>.
           I'm not sure what to call it, it's some combination of
        diy network attached storage, a backup hard drive full of old junk, and our own internet or intranet. I wrote a large rant about this, but i think for now
        i won't put it here, ask me if you want to see it.  

      <p>That's the why(it used to say this after a long paragraph), but the how is the main focus of this website.  I plan to start by at some point making a diy NAS device with two drives, RAID 0. I'm going to at some point
        buy the Argon Eon case, and I'll have a raspberry pi in there with 2 drives.  I hope it can have at least 10 GB of storage.  I think HDD's would be fine, i don't think i need ssds, but that could change. I'd probably
        get drives similar to wd red drives, though I think there are newer, released in 2022 hard drives that I haven't looked into yet.  wd red specifically might not even exist anymore.  I would probably use open media vault
      and maybe I will at first, but i bet togos has a better way, so whatever data i saved on my first draft of this, i'd let him change the os to whatever he wants and just make sure he has the same data i decided to save
      in addition to whatever data he feels might be important, or i'd have my NAS
    at one of my houses, and he'd have his at ws3.  Or we could have lots and lots of nas devices everywhere with different hardware and different os's.  But for just the one that I priced out, it was $700, so like most computer
    things in the world, it gets expensive fast.</p>


      <p>more recently, i thought about making a local web server with raspberrry pi zero w that would have a small website with lots of files that i could hand to you and
        it would be at a certain ip address at my or someone else's or everyone else's house.  Maybe they could also communicate through some sort of long range radio like
      lora or something, but they'd be offline.</p>
