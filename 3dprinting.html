    <h3>TPU Shoes</h3>
    <span style="text-align:left">
    <i>What is tpu?</i>
    <p>I understand tpu to be a type of rubber filament.  I have never printed with it before.  From what i've read it should work with 
      the creality ender 5 pro i have without any special modificaitons, just a change in temperature. 
    </p>

    <i>What can you do with it that you can't do with pla or abs?</i>
    <p>TPU is basically like rubber, so it flexes a little bit, it's not as hard and brittle.   The two things I want to do with it are: <br>
      <br>1. remake my
      car phone holder that is currently made from cardboard with tpu.  Pla didn't work for that because it was too rigid, and the holder
      needs to be a little bit flexible in the corners to hold the phone in, cardboard is flexible enough, the pla ones i printed were 
      not flexible enough, I think tpu would work great.  
      <br>
      <br>
      2. make tpu shoes.  i think i actually have seen a pair at 5 below.  I will try to remember to take a photo of them next time i'm there.
      below are pictures of two reddit threads where people talk about this.

        <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ender5/comments/c9fbd0/can_the_ender_5_print_tpu_out_of_box/">This</a> comment is what lead me to 
          believe that I can print with the printer as is using tpu.  Maybe these guys are lying, but this convinced me that it probably works,
          so i'm going to give it a try.

          <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/s80ipc/yup_its_3d_printed_crocs_in_tpu_because_pla_would/">This</a> comment 
            shows a picture of someone actually printing shoes, I'm pretty sure i could press the go button to make the printer print exactly the
            same pair of shoes that the op did.  The other commenters of course argue about whether it's cost effective 
            or not.   Anyone who sees this site knows which side of that debate i'm on.  i think we should be able to make our own
            stuff at our own houses, and we should do it at any cost, though i would point out that we might be able to make our
            own (possibly bioplastic from leaves) filament for free eventually.
            
            <!--old, funny but offensive: including the cost of our own lives and the lives of our families.  
            Of course with enough stocks of filament, which can be for sale sometimes, or, with our own
            plastic to pla recycling machine, or access to our own raw resources from our own lands, or with secret excessively armed, 
            excessively stressful, night missions to the 
            elver park leaf pile and some method of creating our own rubbery filament from yard waste, we could easily do it for 
            less than it costs the shadow to enslave the weiger 
            region aka Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China then send it all on barges and pay several fees and taxes to 
            walmart on top of that.  Their productive
            superiority is an illusion they can maintain only because our lifespans are so short, we're so easy to control, 
            they have propaganda and armies, they control the minds of all the girls, they print the money and set the prices, etc.  
            So i'm printing the shoes!!! as soon 
            as i get some tpu.  The leaf/bioplastic tpu and beating the dollar store's productive efficiency can come later. -->

    <h3>2nd Dog Bone Mold</h3>

    <div>
     <p>The guy from craigslist texted me and asked me to print another dog bone.  he said the incomplete mold from last time worked in a good way.  I stopped the first print at 75% complete on purpose.
     I'm still going to print him another normal one too.  I'm also going to measure the mm of his existing incomplete mold and see if my new 75% one is bigger or smaller.  I'll let him know it's 75% complete so that he
    can keep that in mind when recording his future results.</p>
    <br>

    <i>update 8-30-2022</i>
    <p>I printed a 75% mold and a 100% one again and met him outside again.  He showed me the case for his project.  This case used the molded plastic that he had made with the molds i 3d printed. The backplate of this plastic
      case was aluminum foil, there was a lot of artwork on the painted cardboard shell.  The dogbones themselves appear to have lots of special vitamins and nutrients.
      He told me he would have a professional level website up soon and would send me the link.
      I gave the molds to him, he wanted to venmo me for it but i didn't have venmo so i guess he either couldn't pay me because he didn't have cash or forgot to pay me.
    I am planning to download venmo as a result of this. That's not what's important about this meeting though, what is important is that I told him about a couple of my ideas, the car phone holder and the lamp kit and let him know
  that i intend to get a patent on them and do the same thing he's doing.  I told him about might try to approach the poetic case company eventually too.  He told me he was a patent lawyer and offered to do a patent search for me for
free.  This is amazing. I plan to work on understanding and applying for a provisional patent along with finalizing both designs and printing better prototypes.  I also am going to post both ideas here on this 3d printing page.</p>

        <i>A dog bone for a customer on Craigslist.</i>
        <p>Someone on craigslist wanted someone to 3d print a model for them.
        It turned out he wanted to use an advanced vacuum mold he had.  He wanted to use this dog bone that I 3d printed for him as the mold.  He seemed to intend to sell thousands of them.  He paid me $25.00 for it.</p>
