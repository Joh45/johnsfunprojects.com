            <p>I didn't take pictures of it, but I had trouble with my rog gladius 2 mouse.  When I clicked, the mouse button got stuck.  At first I was thinking of replacing it,
            and that was interesting because I found out that my mice are a little bit behind the times, and that the most effective gaming mice
            in 2022 are very lightweight.  A good example of one of the newer type is the logitech g pro x superlight, so that was interesting to look into, and I might get
            something more like that if/when i build the new pc i've been planning,
            but then i decided to look into fixing it.
            </p>
            <p>
            I guess I knew, but I don't think of it very often, that you can open mice up, so i did.  I found the hidden screws
            on the bottom and unscrewed them, it separated into two pieces, one the outer shell, and the other the board with the wheel and all the inner electronics.  I
            washed the shell with dishwasher soap in the sink.  For the other part i used q tips, paper towels, tooth picks(the kind that come with the disposable floss things),
            and rubbing alcohol.  The rubbing alcohol dissolved in the air before it could do any damage to anything.  I was willing to risk it because it was broken anyway.
            Anyway, i went back and did the same thing with my rog gladius 1 mouse, a heavier mouse of better construction, that I always liked.  It had a broken mouse wheel.
            I was able to clean it carefully, and i pressed all of the inner switches including the mouse wheel switch several times.  I plugged it in and it came back to life.
            It is still missing the left rubber grip, so I looked that up too and found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCz7aGU5hhE">this</a> odd video where a guy
            replaces his mouse grips with a type of hockeystick tape, I ordered the tape using my amazon reward points and it is on its way.  I plan to clean my keyboard in this
            same way, with the rubbing alcohol.
            </p>
            <p>
            I have always been less cautious than most people about cleaning electronic equipment, components, and computer monitors.  This is because I think
            all the warnings about water getting into a monitor's casing, etc. are strange cultural relics of 1980's crt monitor instruction books.  Water is not nearly as damaging
            to modern lcd panels as people think, they're better designed to take it nowadays, and also, there's electronics cleaning sprays, like a certain kind of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pledge-Surface-Antibacterial-Everyday-Cleaner/dp/B00QQI1WSY/ref=asc_df_B00QQI1WSY/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=385194985119&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14263945201564460252&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9018952&hvtargid=pla-834812938009&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=84195605171&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=385194985119&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14263945201564460252&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9018952&hvtargid=pla-834812938009">pledge multisurface cleaner,</a> that are designed to clean electronics now.
            Of course you can't be 100% stupid with it, you need to have a little bit of caution, but cleaning is not impossible, and is very good for equipment, much
            better than allowing it to be damaged by dust and other contaminants.  Still though, I haven't applied that to mice in the past as much as i should have, but
            now I know, so I'll be cleaning them a lot more, and opening them up a lot more often from now on.
            </p>
            <p>
            I also have a type of green 50% rubbing alcohol from the dollar store
            that dries faster than normal rubbing alcohol, and has wintergreen in it, so it smells better. I put it in a cap and dipped q tips in it,
            i should remember that this type of rubbing alcohol exists, it probably will not be
            in the dollar store forever.(note- later found it's in walgreens too).
