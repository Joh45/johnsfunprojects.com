          <p> In the front of ws2 there are windows.  In front of these windows, we have always tried to make a garden. The house used to not have gutters 
            and have rocks all around it to catch the water in an 
            interesting, experimental way, but this was slowly lost on all of the owners who came after the original builder, who
            was someone who built the house in much the same way i would build a house.  Lots of creative ideas, 1-5% incredible unique to this world execution, 30% poor execution, 
            and some very risky ideas. Anyway, i think the rocks all around the house were originally supposed to be like a french drain or similar system.  they 
            were an attempt to eliminate the need for gutters.  Now obviously after the first guy moved, the house was bought by a series of
            busy corporate employees who didn't have time to think about eliminating the need for gutters and who wanted grass and flowers instead of 
            rock gardens.  They also probably thought that having no gutters and lots of rocks looked weird, which it might have. Maybe the system
            was unsuccessful too, maybe there was a leak or a flood at some point.  A flood would have been more likely if there was something about the rocks
            that had to be understood and maintained and wasn't understood or maintained.  Maybe the steep hill the house is on was designed to 
            let water naturally flow away, but with the growth of the tree and erosion, i could easily see that plan being ruined.  So gutters were put up and grass and flowers were planted, maybe
            the rocks were covered with dirt as well.  The only place the rocks remain is in the back, and whatever overall system they were a part of
            was likely destroyed years before we got there in 1996.  In front of the windows, there was only dirt by the time we got there.  The rocks were gone.  The slope of the hill 
            was probably less steep.  There were still no gutters, they had to be purchased. A decision i certainly agreed with given the fact that the original design 
            was no longer in a salvagable state.  
          </p>
            
            <p>
            To cover up the dirt in 1997 we made a raised bed planter box out of some sort of landscaping logs and filled it with 
            soil, then put flowers in it.  So great, there was a little garden box with perenial flowers in the front, that seems good, but the tree loved the good soil in there and
            so every year the planter box would be filled with large tree roots by the end of the year.  So every spring, up until at least 2014, i would have to dig out all of the 
            tree roots, down to slighly below ground level and then fill it with new soil.  Not with any power tools or anything sensible like that either, just with an old shovel, 
            a shovel i plan to repair as i did to the other two shovels that can be seen on the garden tool page on this site.  It was like digging a fighting hole or something every year,
            the tree roots were always very difficult to find and chop through.  It was surprising how big they could get every year, how quickly they grew back. 
             As a 30+ year old wage slave with some serious problems, it was not a good use of 
            my time or energy.  It seems like something the military would have me do, but they don't even do it in as dumb of a way, and yeah it could be good training, but
            training to be what? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNne9QX6P6c">A rifle scout</a>/sniper in world war 1?  That is an obsolete weapons system now.  
            So i guess, being a former boy scout, i'm an obsolete weapons system now too.  
            There's drones, satillites, airplanes, computers, and cameras now
            that do the job of scouting a modern battlefield much better than any human ever could
            and i thought everyone in my family and all my friends were against all of the recent wars, and especially against world war 1 for that matter. (everyone loved ww2, but 
            most wars can't be that cool).  <!--I thought we weren't going to let all of these governments get away with keeping all these wars going, but now
            everyone seems to be joining them, i guess it's no surprise, john lasky doesn't pay you as much as the fed can, he doesn't pay you anything at all, 
            he more tells you that you don't need money, food,
            etc and that you just need to be tougher and stand outside in the rain screaming, but if you want to eat breakfast or something, the governments of the 
            world definitely have better options for you like egg mcmuffins, peppermint mochas, etc.  and sure, you'll fall right into their loving arms.  
            I'm not sure how i as an individual person became the other side really, maybe i just
            got sucked into that vacuum of power, that void, but now i'm stuck there being the opposition to over 8 billion people with all their armies and 
            governments and religions and money and of course that means i can't win
            but of course i'm still going to complain when you people don't join me.-->
            (Maybe students in schools, and all schools, are an obsolete weapons system now too, as much of the motivation behind the creation and funding of modern math and science
            cirriculums was to win the space race, compete against the soviets, build nuclear weapons, etc.  Maybe ai can do that type of thinking better now, 
            or at least it will be able to soon.) 
            </p>
            <p>
            I decided not to join the 
            army or air force in 2002 for lots of reasons, like it's wrong to kill people, it's wrong to pump halliburton stock, etc., so right or wrong, like it or not, 
            i didn't join.  So then why should i still dig out 
            this weird thing every year?  Am i going to keep 
            doing it when i'm 70?
            Also, I had shoulder surgery in late 2014, and this garden/maple tree root digging stuff was never very good for my shoulders, it was a contributing factor
            to the failure of both of my shoulders. Training can be bad if it causes injury. So i guess in spring of 2015 i didn't dig it out and it 
            became a priority to find a new solution.  
            Now i'm quite hazy on the exact time line as usual, but at around this same time period, ws1 was being built.  On a trip to home depot, i 
            saw a small planter box made of wood, that was shaped not exactly like, but almost like the box i made.  it was more simple, it had a flat bottom. it was
            much smaller, probably made out of a single long board.  At that time i was pretty focused on noticing things that I could make, and a little box like
            this seemed pretty easy.  I made a small one of the same size, only mine had legs.  I did not cut it all out of a straight board like they did, i instead
            wasted some wood by cutting out each piece without caring about the other pieces. I used some of the scraps to make the legs on each corner,  this gave 
            me a thicker surface to nail through on the corners too.  I made this at ws1 and took it home and put it on the back porch.  Maybe a year later, I dug out 
            the box full of tree roots for the last time.  This time we built a flat floor out of of <a href="images/redpavestone.png">red stepping stones.</a> 
            The ground underneath was reinforced by a few layers of things like bricks, rocks, and moisture barriers.  The tree roots are definitely through all of that
            by now, but seem to not want to break through the top pave stones.  Maybe the tree now recognizes that as ground level.  The same logs that made up the 
            old planter box are simply placed like a fence around
            this red stone platform.
          </p>
            <p>Anyway i was asked to make four large planter boxes modeled after the little one, so i did.  However, in my opinion they
            are way too big.  They also are made out of pretty fragile plywood.  At first I did not reinforce them because the original design did not need reinforcement,
            and they held up without reinforcement for at least 1 year.  The next year two of them were damaged to the point that they became backups, and pumpkin
            planters, the two less damaged ones were reinforced with wood and a layer of fencing and burlap and repainted black.  Every year they still have to be dug out, 
            but it's much less digging than there used to be with the old flower box and there's 
            no tree roots in them.  They have lasted at least 5 years now, but this year one of them finally rotted out on the bottom, so it has been replaced.  The 
            other one will probably need replacing too.  Instead of 4 boxes, there's 2, but also there's several geraniums that are moved outside in the summer and inside 
            in the winter.  The two large specification is still there with the new box.  I would much rather make smaller ones out of cedar.  They would be a lot 
            more durable.  So I do plan to do that.  Maybe the wall around the garden has to be changed.  the brick exterior walls all need to be painted, i'm considering
            painting the bricks white, like a neighbor did.  I might try to paint the concrete walls on the sides of the house white also.  i would have to do this in
            early spring though, and I never really stick to my plans to paint, though i did paint the garage doors a few years ago. So at some point, maybe next year,
            maybe in 2024 i will both paint everything and build new smaller boxes.
