      <h3>Project Overview</h3>

      <div>

        <h6><i>6-26-2022, notes about reorginaztion project.</i></h6>
        <p>Multiple areas need to be reorganized.</p>
        <p>At my condo, I plan to take out the carpet, paint the floor, move the bed, build a big shelf behind the bed, get some new furniture,
        get rid of old furniture, and maybe paint the cabinets.  I plan to have more details on the page on this site that's dedicated to plans for my condo.</p>
        <p>At my sister's house, there is a plan to remodel the garage and basement.  To help this get done, i need to move all things from the garage into the basement
        while the garage gets remodeled, then move it back in to the garage while the basement gets remodeled. There has already been a garage sale to reduce the total amount of things, and that itself was a project.
        I then need to create a floor plan for the future remodeled living room side of
        the basement that is acceptable to everyone.  I think the bookshelf area should be the new tv area. It's sad that the bookshelf will probably be gone,
        but the bookshelf has never been an actual good place for books because they gather dust down there, they are not seen and get damaged and no one looks at them just because
        they are in an impractical location, so while a bookshelf there seems like a nice idea, it doesn't really work over time.  If it were a giant tv with nice furniture and the
        possible new window, it could be a very useful area.  The fireplace bricks should be cleaned and/or painted as part of the remodeling if possible.  I want both the garage and
        basement floors to be epoxy.  My dad wants half the basement floor to have permanent carpet.  I think this is a terrible idea, I prefer a rug that can be moved/cleaned/replaced when, not if, it gets damaged by water,
        but it seems like it will unfortunately be a permanent carpet on that half of the room, so at Least i hope to make sure that a hard epoxy floor will be underneath it.
        The crafting table area will be about the same, but of course rebuilt and reorganized.  The computer desks will be almost the same, except I plan to have a giant shelf
        there with squares for multiple computers, a computer wall, with doors.  I know this might reduce
        airflow, but i think stopping dust is more important, and I will try to figure out ideas to solve the airflow problem, or maybe just a door for each square,
        that i make sure is open if that computer is on and then close it when it's off.  Maybe on the lower half of this computer wall shelf there should not be computer squares, but
        drawers, or a very organized cord and accessory storage area. maybe there could be 3 small shelves like this, instead of one huge one, that might make them easier to build.  I think the ceiling and walls
        are going to be white.  The place where the tv is now should possibly be open, but with some sort of little barrier or divider wall so that extra laundry could go there.  I'm afraid that could make everything smell bad, but
        that's going to be true if it's in the hallway too.  Maybe that area could also have things like dehumidifiers, air filters, the vaccuum etc. kind of a laundry and climate control part of the room.  I'm going to make
        a sweet home 3d map with different furniture configurations that will show all these ideas.</p>
        <section><p>It's possible that my friend's house along with the first workshop needs to be reorganized, though I don't know how, and cannot at the moment think of specific plans like the two places above.  There is some possiblity that
        we can build small buildings there, which seems like a necessary thing to learn how to do.</p></section>
        <section><p>I might temporarily rent a storage locker, so that I can put stuff there.  I'd like to know what it's like, maybe that would help me learn more about storage lockers, which might be a good thing to
          own and rent out to people in the future.  Of course, it's at least $100 per month, so I would limit myself to one month.  It could be particularly helpful with ripping out the carpet and painting at my
        condo, as i could possibly store everything from the condo in a locker for one month and get all the work done.  i never feel like doing that of course, but it could make sense, maybe I should get the new furniture delivered
      there first.  It would be nice to have the room completely emptied, then do what i have to do, even add curtains, then put only the stuff i want to put back in the room, and relocate, sell or dispose of the rest.  Then cancel the locker.
      I need more energy and money to be able to really do this, maybe next year.  I don't think it would help in the other locations as much, but maybe this idea of temporarily having a storage locker could help with future locations.
