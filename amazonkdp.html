        <h6><i>Questions and Answers</i></h6>
        <span class="leftalgn">
        <p><b>What is this?</b></p>

        <p>-I found out it's possible to design your own notebooks for free(sort of) and amazon will post/print/sell them for you/to you.  It's called something like "no content or low content publishing using amazon kdp".</p>

        <p><b>When did this start?</b></p>

        <p>-After my shoulder surgery on 2/15/2022, I could only use my left arm and youtube started recommending
        videos about making contentless books using amazon kdp.</p>

        <p><b>Is this a scam?</b></p>
        <p>-Yes, like everything, actually a little bit more than everything, it's a scam, BUT on the other hand,
        I've always kind of wanted to design my own notebook cover.  Not really enough to ever think about it though, until now.</p>

        <p><b>Do you think it could work?</b></p>
        <p>
        -It already has a little bit because I already made a notebook and sent it to myself.  Actually 2 notebooks, but one of them had some problems.

        <p><b>but work like make money?</b></p>

        <p>-Probably not, it only could if I were to make thousands of them and
        luckily make one design that people start buying.  People also make word search books and stuff like that, and I wouldn't mind doing that either.
        This is also a way that I could publish and print my own books without any approval from anyone.  So I think it's kind of a good thing to know about even though
        it's unlikely that I'll ever build up the willpower to do it enough to make any money or to make other people happy.  I would need to take some extreme measure like adding making one book into my schedule every day.</p>
        </p>

        <p><b>What resources did you use to learn how to do it?</b></p>
        <p>Probably the best channel about this was Rachel Harrison-Sund's channel, I signed up to be on her email list and in her sales funnel and got the
      pdf that explains how to make a small journal. I never bought anything from her, but I don't think she's bad, i considered taking her class but it was of course
      very expensive, so I didn't.  I don't really have more to learn, I already know how to do it, just from watching free videos, but i would need to be very dedicated
      to do it.  i also block youtube ads with adguard plus, so I'm not getting tricked, youtube is.  I am subscribed to canva though, so maybe it's a canva scam and it worked if that's true.</p>

        <h3>Problems with this project</h3>

        <div class="leftalgn">
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>my larger notebook was supposed to be red, but the author's copy they sent me was orange.  I don't know why.  This shouldn't matter all that much, i should just fix it, but it somehow became a psychological block that stopped me from wanting to work on making more notebooks.  Now that i'm writing it here, i see it's a smaller problem than i felt like it was.</li>
              <li>the lines in the large notebook have a slight gap at the far edge, this could be good, but i have to check normal notebooks to see if that's how notebooks are supposed to be or not.</li>
              <li>I like colored lines in notebooks.  I have a draft in canva of a blue lined notebook.  Unfortunately it would cost more to print it.  Still I need to print one with that draft next time, if i decide
              i'm ok with or learn how to fix the small line gap.</li>
              <li>being subscribed to canva costs money and is against my belief that I should own the programs I use, and have them on my hard drive. This isn't the only thing i subscribed to canva for and I do break this rule sometimes, tinkercad is free, but still breaks this rule,
                even steam breaks it a little, there's no one who cares if i subscribe to things or not other than me really, so I can break this rule whenever i want, but in general i don't want to have other people own my files
              and i don't want to be paying large sums of money to be subscribed to too many things that i don't even use enough and that there are alternatives to.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Ideas</h3>

        <div class="leftalgn">
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>gain an understanding of the color problem, search for other people who may have had the same issue, try to make a red notebook that really is red, try to make a green notebook, etc.</li>
              <li>create a notebook with each color.</li>
              <li>try to publish more than one notebook at a time to see if it works</li>
              <li>I need to Remember that I found a creative solution to amazon banning blank notebook covers, I put the title on the side, and found the correct measurement to do that and it worked.
              this should be an advantage, maybe I need to improve my search terms or something.</li>
              <li>make a graph paper notebook, that would be a good next step.</li>
              <li>i eventually want to get off of canva and learn how to do what it does for me, for myself, with libre office or something, but that ability will come if i do make enough notebooks, because eventually i will learn
                the dimensions of everything on an intuitive level and then i hopefully won't need canva to do it for me.  Maybe there will be a downloadable or open source replacement for canva eventually too, maybe the free version of canva along with another program could work.</li>
            </ol>
