      <div>
       <p>I thought of an idea of making cutting mats, like rubber cutting mats, but out of cardboard, then clamping them down.  I want to somehow waterproof the cardboard, paint it white, and Maybe
       stamp measuring pictures on it, just like a work mat.  I'd like it to possibly have the same rubber feel.  there are many things i could try to finish the cardboard with.  I'm going to make a
       project page about this in the woodworking section.  I'm going to try a variety of finishes on small pieces of cardboard, and look into making a ruler stamp or carving a large stamp out of wood</p>
       <p>I should  change the recent section and make it more of a permanent top of the index page section somehow, and I should have a journal or log instead of using this as that, and this should
         become more of a technical details section about this site</p>
      <p>I should move everything from recent into other sections</p>
      <p>i bought a dremel 4000 kit, i plan to use it to sand the shovel and hopefully finish recording the tool restoration video tomorrow or in the next two days.</p>
      <p>if i have time i should both post this site and fix my youtube legacy system page. </p>
      <p> i need to post about my second meeting with the 3d printing guy and make other 3d printing posts.</p>

       <p>Finally finished up linking to every current page, so time consuming, boring and difficult to not get distracted from. In the future I will do that as i create new pages. they're all still contentless, but now i'll have a place to
       put updates if i do work on any of them, and also i'll never be short of things to write about and i can see all the things i could possibly be doing.</p>
       <p>still planning to create gardening and cooking sections</p>
       <p>thought about making a cooking tik tok or youtube channel, but for the types of food i make, sandwiches, quick breakfasts, breakfast pizzas.  maybe it should be called sandwich spy.
       this sounds like something i'll never do, but thought i'd write it down anyway.</p>
       <p>i also think i should add a music section and maybe a replays section to the aoe2 site</p>

      <h3>7-30-2022 notes</h3>

      <div>
       <p>I was thinking of the footer section where there's the different ideas and resources pages.  The way i have it set up now, it's hard to distinguish it from
         my regular pages.  I wanted it to be more like a list of downloadable pdfs and youtube links, maybe lists of cool equipment with brief descriptions of each thing, like an inventory.
        Maybe I should reduce them to 3 or so.  Or have one for articles, one for ideas, one for youtube links.  Maybe I should make an update one, but that could just be part of the top of page update section too.
       </p>
       <p>I also had thoughts about replacing the recent section with a more permanent start to the page that lists recent updates.  Not sure how or if that would combine with or mention this page.</p>
       <p>9:44am - made basic overview page of <a href="bookshelf.html">bookshelf.</a></p>
       <p>i'm also considering getting rid of the status section under each picture, and making that part the pages, maybe in the overview, maybe i could have the status section be one word, maybe i don't need it at all.<p>
        <p>good name for a youtube channel, sandwich spy, where you go around finding out how restaurants make sandwiches then try to copy them.  this may be illegal, would be difficult to update consistently,
           and you may get cancelled, but it would work for a while.</p>

        <p>I've been pretty sick.  I've made some doctor's appointments.  I haven't been working on things very effectively lately.</p>
        <p>yesterday, I fixed a shovel by sharpening it with an angle grinder and painting it with rustoleum rust reformer.  I think it worked out pretty well
          I suppose I'll make it into a complete project in the gardening section after I make the gardening section.
        </p>
        <p>the craigslist 3d printing thing went awesome, the client(?) paid me $25. I still need to make the 3d printing page, and it feels like it's going to take a while to get it
          started.  I might and might not have a post for each thing I printed, with a date.
        </p>
        <p>
          Created, and made an update to, <a href="roglaptop/roglaptop.html">rog laptop page</a>.  The update was that I repaired my mouse, and my older mouse.

        <p>This site definitely takes a while to update, so I am going to have to make a basic page for each thing, then only actually complete the pages
          as i work on the different projects.  So I'll make some sort of basic overview page, then only complete each page as I work on it.  I wanted to avoid this,
          but it's probably better.  I also thought about adding the top of page button to the side menu of each page.  I also need to have the footer links actually go
          somewhere, maybe a template sort of page for that too, though the articles will be tough, i haven't really tried uploading pdfs yet.  The stores should also go
          to stores, the more details should go to this.  I also thought about putting each new page in a folder, or maybe a folder within a folder, though maybe there's
          an easy way to do that automatically later.  Maybe for some parts of the filter I should have an under construction or coming soon type of link.

        <p>11:10pm, i'm fixing the etsy store plan picture on the main page so it's the same size as the others.  11:16pm, done.</p>
        <p>11:16pm, fixing sawing natural wood picture on index page. 11:27, done.  Took too long but doesn't matter, quitting for day because of new rule about not

        <p>Yesterday and today I mainly slept, cleaned, and attempted to fix my sister's pc with the graphics card.  It worked, but it isn't any better, it's still throttled by its processor.  I tried installing drivers, etc.
        but it really didn't make that much of a difference.  I guess I have to work on that page, and by extension all commputer pages next, since i'll be using the same sections in a lot of them.</p>

        <p>2:14pm, About the footer, I will figure it out at some point, maybe just javascript resizing, maybe detect screen size and pick a different html footer
          page depeding on screen size and/or device type, but it's fine for now. I'll add it to an issues section when i make one.  I might add a gtx550 graphics card(it's a more sensible option for the cpu etc.) to my sister's computer
          either later today or tomorrow.  So maybe I'll work on the sections for every computer site, like backstory, specs, upgrades needed, etc.  Oh also I will try to take a picture of the new speaker i added to the living room pc.
          Maybe I'll make a section showing all the things on my sister's pc, like the way windows 8 is set up, that make it nice.</p>

    <!-- secret idea: a series of youtube videos that's like red pill or mgtow videos, but it basically accuses women of bestiality and not being attracted to HUMAN men at all and has lots of statistics and interviews to prove it
    don't take the red pill, don't take the blue pill, take the ZOO pill.  take that one graphic that shows 5 women pointing to only one man, and switch it to 5 men and a lion and have them all pointing at the lion.
    There's got to be an interview portion where a guy approaches girls at the beach and asks them who they think is more attractive
  then shows them pictures of like lebron james, steve jobs, etc, and a picture of a male lion, and whether this is true or not, have them always pick the lion/duck/whatever animal.  Then have a high energy video of a guy similar to
  david goggins talking about a day his wife asked to go to the zoo, with a long story that ends up with him seeing her in the fuckin tiger pit getting gang banged by 6 tigers or something.  Honey, what the fuck??!!!J?
all pictures blurred out of course. maybe a long series of videos or training montage of a guy trying to get faster, only to lose a race to a cheetah.  maybe another video where two attractive men go to a club, one as himself,
and one in a lion costume, and no one dances with him and everyone dances with the guy in the lion suit, then they
switch clothes and the same thing happens again, this time the formerly rejected guy, now in a lion costume, gets all the girls.  also have a cruel display of the food chain play out in front
of a bunch of girls at the beach, where there's all sorts of zoo bros catching, then fighting over the corpse of, an antelope or goat, the guy playing the prey of course makes dying goat sounds and
has some sort of fake blood.  There could then be a guy dressed as a raccoon approach and try to eat and the lion guy and him start fighting, then some seagulls, vultures and other birds fly(flap their arms) in there, all with nice elaborately
constructed feather arms and beak masks.  maybe some of them making rediculous sounds like arp, arp, arp, or mrrraaaa.
   this channel probably would be banned, but it has to announce it's going to what's that called again,
odysee.  maybe have tutorials about how to dance like different animals, then sell costumes with affiliate links too haha.  they should all be a version that high cardio type of dance you like forget the name, shuffle dance.

        <p>9:24am, I was able to sleep for some reason, which is the main thing i need to do.  About the footer, I solved the resizing problem for the most part with a width=100% property.
          The page still has some white space on the bottom because if I don't specify height,
        it cuts off the bottom if it's resized or viewed from a smartphone.  height=100% really doesn't seem to do anything, not sure why. i think the width 100% might be working off of the div and that div doesn't have any css height properties,
      and maybe shouldn't.  I am bothered by this problem, but it also works if people aren't looking too closely at it, so i think i'll leave it as it is at least for now.
      At least now I have a footer that I can change in one place.  I could possibly fix it later, i know that's a bad thing to say too often, but i also don't want to stop making progress on adding pages and content.</p>

      <p>10:58am.  I ate breakfast and took a short walk to the mailbox.  I was thinking that in each project there could if necessary be a research topic section, like for your condo, there could be a folding furniture research
        thing.  or for a new pc build it could show different parts you've been looking at.  well for that there should be a draft builds section.  This wouldn't be a footer library of articles type of research section, it would just
        be things i am looking at for a specific part of that particular project.

        <h6><i>6-30-2022</i></h6>
        <p class="leftalgn">12:20 am, after trying html embed, include, and the dom with javascript(the right way but would take me too long), and looking at some jquery,
          I've decided that the most normal, sensible way to do it is with php, sorry everyone who reads this.
          I haven't looked at php in maybe 10 years and not very much back then either. I would generally avoid it and go with javascript, but not for this, so I'll do some basic php tutorials,
          then make the php footer page in the morning. Here's <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-simplest-ways-to-handle-html-includes/">one site</a> that addreses this.</p>

        <p>oh yeah, now i remember, php is server side I need lamp, that's more than just opening an editor, I'm trying to avoid that with this site. Trying AJAX.</p>

        <p>2:35am. Of course ajax didn't work for me, maybe the server side thing again, but i don't think so. Anyway iframes did work, the code that helped me the most was <a
            href="https://generatepress.com/forums/topic/how-to-add-a-footer-below-an-iframe-using-a-template/">here</a>, written by a poster named steve who forgot to write his tag right, and was corrected by tom, i'm glad steve messed up.
            <br>
          it ended up looking like this:
<xmp>
  <iframe src="footer.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="1200px" height="500" name="qa" id="qa"
  onload="this.before((this.contentDocument.body||this.contentDocument).children[0]);this.remove()"></iframe>
</xmp>
<br>
part of that may be unnecessary or even harmful, but i'm ok with it for now. I still have to change all the pages i've made so far to make them work that way but i think i should try to go to bed now.</p>
<br>
update: changed width to from 1080 to 1200px in the iframe thing.

<br>
update: major problem, not resizing right, maybe not centered right, idea: assign the iframe to one of the w3 classes instead of letting it have that id of "qa". not trying now. going to bed.

        <h6><i>6-29-2022</i></h6>
        <p class="leftalgn">I've been thinking that this isn't going fast enough. I need to have at least some sort of page for each thing, then i can start updating what i'm actually working on.
          and also maintaining things that are supposed to happen daily like the 3d printing site.</p>
        <p class="leftalgn">About the 3d printing site, i'd like to make a free wordpress blog called 3d print every day, just because people seem to like workpress for some reason, well i kind of know why, I don't want to subscribe to it though.
          That sounds easy enough, but i think i should do this first, so i'll just do it here, then once i've started working it into my daily schedule, i'll make the other site.</p>
        <p class="leftalgn">I still need to make a gardening section, a music section, and i had some ideas for other sections i forgot about. If rc cars etc. ever gets going, that could be its own section outside of electronics too.</p>
        <p class="leftalgn">today i'll start by doing the chair repair page, because I already have the pictures for that, and after it's done, it will be permanently done because that project is complete.</p>
        <p class="leftalgn">while working on the chair repair site at 4:21pm i had an idea about the workshop sites. i should have a known tools section where i list things i know are there, like a welder, a tablesaw, etc. for each location.
          it doesn't have to be a perfect inventory, just a rough inventory of the big tools from memory, that could be put into a tiny sql or mysql database later but don't have to be. I don't want to get into counting pens and rolls of tape,
          because that would be crazy. but it could be like major tools at each location that come to mind: bandsaw, >3 drills, >2 hammers, mobile mitre saw, 1 worx folding table, 1 unknown folding table with built in power, etc.</p>
        <p class="leftalgn">I keep noticing that the slideshow javascript code is annoying and should be placed in an external js file. I always think of this and then don't do it. It isn't hard to do, though maybe i'd have to pass in the # of
          slides, or use slightly different code,
          not sure. Maybe later today...</p>

        <p class="leftalgn">I actually ran into problems where two slide shows interfered with each other. i solved it in a bad way, making another slideshow css file called slideshow2. I don't like it, i need to either find or make a
          better type of slideshow or make a js or even jsp(java, not javascript) file with slideshow objects or something.</p>

        <p class="leftalgn">At 7:00 I finished the chair repair site, I did do other things, but it took a long time and i had trouble with the slideshows. If it takes this long to do each one, i'm going to only be able to do 1 or 2 a day.
          I need to get faster or find a better way or both. It should take about 20 minutes. I'm going to take a break and clean my room and eat dinner. Maybe I'll do something else after that or maybe i'll come back to this and
          work on the 3d printer part of the site.</p>

        <p class="leftalgn">At 8:12 while doing dishes, i started to think that I can use external js files, and maybe having a s1ideshow1.js and slideshow2.js that refer to slideshow.css could work, and maybe not be as bad as the two css
          files with internal js was. I could at least make copies of them and maybe not have to edit as many elements across different files.
          maybe this would work, so it is not pointeless to try a test slideshow page with a test external js file. you just need to have a second test external js file. I also thought of the idea of having a separate page for a slideshow
          about things in some cases, like a speaker i just got would have a picture of it and a link to all the pictures of it, but that idea is situational and depends on the thing. Anyway external js test now makes sense again. This is not a big
          problem for me,
          this kind of problem happens all the time but i do keep thinking about it. The solution i already have to it already works too, i just don't like it.</p>

        <p class="leftalgn">8:29 finished doing dishes, along the same lines as the external js is replacing the footer with an external html footer. I want to keep this site simple, and use as much basic html as possible.
          I have bad past experiences with trying to make a site like this and just getting caught up in making flex boxes. I also don't want to end up subscribed to shopify pro for $100 per month or something like that,
          so i'm going with basics all the way.
          <br>
          The text on this site is not just a variable that I don't care about, it's actually supposed to help me
          to do projects irl and keep track of them.
          <br>
          I don't want to spend much time thinking about pointless code, that no matter how advanced it is, is going to be thrown away and not cutting edge anymore in a couple of years anyway.
          Adding bootstrap and js and pyscript and dino or whatever else might seem like what I should be doing, but that's not the goal of this site. Still, I don't want to change the footer for every page on the site every time i have to change the
          footer, I just want to
          change it in one place, so I'm going to make a test external footer too. I'm not sure what you call external html or if you even call it external, maybe it's a pointer, or a reference or something, but it doesn't matter.
          I'll have to look that up. It's something i've done before a few years ago though, and i'm going to do it again for the footer. Back to cleaning.
        </p>

        <p class="leftalgn">8:52. For all the computer pages, there should be a specs section, an internal components section(that lists the physical processor(kind of covered by specs, but not from the same point of view), case,
          motherboard, gpu etc.), and an accessories section where it shows speakers, monitors. when they get swapped or switched, or are shared, they get changed to the other computer's page, and that's a short post on both pages.
          there should be an ideas section on this page, that has a list of all ideas like this you think of while doing the logs.
