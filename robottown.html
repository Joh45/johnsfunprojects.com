      <h3>Simulated Town</h3>

      <div>

        <h6><i>A town populated by robots or ais</i></h6>
        <p>I think if you had a simulated town that bought exactly the same products we buy, but only consumed them virtually,
          you could at least double your profits, tax revenues etc.  If there were a warehouse outside of madison
          where there were servers and a little runescape-like world populated by ais who did exactly what and perhaps most importantly bought and 
          sold exactly what we were doing and buying in real life, you could make as much money on that little simulated town as you do from the 
          real town.  Let's say you want to sell a pack of skittles at a store in madison, it would first go to, or more likely just be registered by
          the virtual town facility.  The ais would put it on the shelf of their simulated grocery store, and they would come buy it and do everything we 
          do with it, pretty much buy it and eat it. Then, since the real product was not really consumed in the real world, you could still just
          ship it to the real grocery store where it would also be bought, only this time, really eaten, by an actual human.  but the skittles company and 
          the grocery store, they just sold that pack of skittles twice, doubling their profit.  
          <br>
          <br>
          You could actually have as many virtual towns as you 
          wanted and therefore make as much profit/tax revenue, etc. as you want too.  However, making a robot town would be very expensive at first,
          you would have to pay for everything they were going to buy for a faily(or fairly if you insist on having no sense of humor) 
          long initial period of time, i think 2 years, though maybe that could be 
          shortened to the first month, or 
          even, once the idea is widely known and proven to work, eventually the first few seconds.  But the first town like this would need to be fully 
          funded for i'd say at least the first 2 years, because it would take some time to get the world stabilized and figured out to the point that
          all the (imaginary) people in it would consistently and predictably work, shop, and pay taxes.  
          <br>
          <br>
          You would also need to get stores like walmart, whatever stores exist in
          the real town in on it, because they'd have to pay the ais living in the town the same way they'd pay real humans in the real town.  Also, if a 
          store was in the virtual town, it would have to be required to have a real location in the real town too.  
          <br>
          <br>
          It would likely cost as much as building a new real town in an open field would.  But After the initial expense, it would make as much
          money as a real town does too, except it wouldn't really consume supplies, so everything sold there would be more profitable than 
          selling it in a real town would be, and slowly you could make little tweaks and do little tricks so that things like payment for medical 
          insurance could eventually only be billed to the virtual people and never to real people, as the virtual people would not really be injured, 
          though the (imaginary) doctors treating them would be paid, all the medicine
          wouldn't be consumed, all the equipment wouldn't be real(equipment would be in real life shipped to the real hospital to be actually used, 
          just like the skittles).
          <br>
          <br>
          Since not every normal business like target etc would really cooperate with this because it's too risky for them in the short term,
          you might actually have to build a real human town in a field with real humans, along with the facility, and in that town's plans
          you would need to only allow stores in that agreed to pay the people living in both the real and virtual worlds.

          <br>
          <br>
          Unfortnately making a town like this would probably be much easier in a desert country with a king like saudi arabia or qatar, as 
          if you tried to do it here, walmart would never join/never allow it.  They would agree to it right away if some saudi royal told them he was going to do 
          it though.  Also it's probably harder to find blank buildable land for a brand new town in wisconsin, and you'd have no volunteers going to live there here.
          This idea would have to be proven to work somewhere else before you could prove that it works enough for them(the big box stores, the brainwashed citizens) 
          to agree to do it here.
          <br>
          <br>
          At first I wanted this to be an actual physical robot town, and i bet that would make more profits(per town) and be more interesting and understandable
          to the average person, but it wouldn't be possible to maintain, and it would take up way too much space and cause too much pollution.
          <br>
          <br>
          There are of course so many other complications and details about this.  Like could you make the virtual world buy stuff faster? Is this a 
          good idea for a new cryptocurrency? would people invest in this if this were a cryptocurrency? could you make a new crypto currency based on this and
          then get the attention of an actual US state or foreign country that wanted to find a location for it and fund it with a normal currency?  
          would the ais act like the ais in oblivion?  Are the ais
          intelligent slaves or just dumb computers? Would some weird group of economists or businessmen start calling the ais crypto consumers? 
          Is our world already a vitual 
          revenue-generating world that's making some other world's lives easier? is that
          why we(well maybe not me but people) have to work excessively?  would they still need to commit crimes?(i think yes) Could you 
          increase the virtual full time work week to 50 hours a week and by doing that decrease the real town's full time work week to 30 hours a week
          but pay both the same?  could you gift the ais with bodies that only needed one hour of sleep and still give them the same amount of time off?(leisure time
          is key to parts of the economy and especially to certain towns like wisconsins dells, i don't think a pure slave virtual world would be as profitable, but 
          with less of a sleep requirement maybe they could both work more than a slave, play more than a billionaire, and probably also sit there doing nothing more than 
          people who sit there doing nothing.  You could do a lot with those 7+ extra hours) 
          Does this get less profitable the more it differs from reality or more profitable?, is there a point where the real world supply chain
          is somehow endangered by tweaking things too much? is there a sweet spot? could real humans work certain jobs in the simulated world and get paid for it?
          could you not make a whole town at first, just a suburb or some part of a town?  Could a virtual town simply donate its real supplies to a struggling
          3rd world country or poor area?(after the initial investment, it would still be making as much doing this as a regular town would, just not double)
          I'll write little paragraphs about all of that when I think of it.
