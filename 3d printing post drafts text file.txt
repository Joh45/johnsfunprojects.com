          <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
          <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a
            piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
            McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
            the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going
            through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
            source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
            et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book
            is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
            first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
            comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

          <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
          <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
            content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum
            is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
            using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
            desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
            default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites
            still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
            sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
